        For Mozart, the year was going to contain an 
        important taste of things to come: <i>1762</i> was 
        significant for him because it was when he was
        introduced to the art of travel. He undertook 
        three mini-tours across the year, none of them
        very long in itself, but when taken as a whole,
        they would have given Mozart — and to be 
        fair, Leopold — some idea of what lay in store
        for them. In January they travelled to 
        Munich — a place Mozart would come to know fairly
        well — where both Nannerl and Mozart were invited 
        to play for Elector Maximilian Joseph.

        In October the same year, Leopold hauled both
        children off to Vienna. Just as it is today, this
        great city was the beating heart of music in the
        Austrian lands. Once again, the youngsters were 
        noticed by the powers that be and asked to play at
        the Viennese court, which they did on 13 October.

        Mozart was about to spend 3 years on the road 
        playing to dukes and barons, emperors and empresses,
        and kings and queens. Mozart was about to embark on
        a tour that would take in 17 cities in seven 
        different countries.
