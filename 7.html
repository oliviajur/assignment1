        On 5 December 1791, the composer Wolfgang 
        Amadeus Mozart died at his home in Vienna, 
        Austria at the age of 35. The circumstances 
        of his death have attracted much 
        research and speculation.

        The principal sources of contention are: 
        (1) Whether Mozart declined gradually, 
        experiencing great fear and sadness, or 
        whether he was fundamentally in good spirits 
        toward the end of his life, then felled 
        by a relatively sudden illness; (2) Whether 
        the cause of his death was from disease or poisoning; 
        (3) Whether his funeral arrangements were the normal 
        procedures for his day, or if they were 
        of a disrespectful nature.

        There are a range of views on each of these points,
        many of which have varied radically over time.
