        In 1766, far from winding down the tour as
        they made their way back home, the schedule
        became ever more punishing. By the time the 
        first signs of summer had arrived in May, 
        Mozart had already played in Utrecht, Amsterdam,
        Antwerp and Brussels. Leopold’s experiences on 
        tour had been a revelation to him. Back in Salzburg, 
        he was a mere public servant, paid — not a massive
        amount — to provide music on demand. On the road, 
        the family were received by royalty and treated 
        almost as equals. Just as would be the case for 
        Mozart some years later, Leopold had no burning 
        desire to return to the status quo. So, on 10 May, 
        they revisited Paris. They stayed there for 2 leisurely
        months and, concerts and receptions aside, 
        behaved like tourists.

        Back in Salzburg, things returned to normal for Leopold.
        For Mozart himself, there probably was no version of 
        'normal' to return to. He had been only 7 when they left
        home and had travelled for much of the year leading 
        up to his grand tour anyway.

        During his time in Vienna, Mozart wrote an opera, 
        Lafinta semplice, which translates as “The make-believe idiot”.
        Leopold tried hard to get the work performed, but to no
        avail. The rumours circulating about Mozart were getting 
        stronger. While some were saying, as they had always done, that
        Mozart’s musicality was nothing short of miraculous, others were
        beginning to doubt that a miracle of this magnitude could occur. 
        A 12-year-old boy? Writing a fully fledged opera? Well, it couldn’t 
        be possible. They believed it must have been the work of Leopold, 
        who was passing off his own compositions as the boy’s to make money! 
        But the live performances that astonished crowds when they witnessed
        them first hand? How could they be faked? Well, obviously some of 
        the reports were just lies, claimed the detractors. But what about
        the way he could improvises spectacularly on themes given to him 
        by members of his audience? And the way he could play virtually 
        any piece from sight? Well, clearly, so the rumourmongers would say,
        these were pulled off with prearranged stooges, in much the same
        way as cheap conjurers would do.

        Little did he know at the outset, but 1769 was going to prove
        an important year for Mozart. He spent virtually the whole time
        in Salzburg, which must have felt rather unusual for him. As a 
        result, his compositions were created almost exclusively for 
        Archbishop Schrattenbach’s court and for the adjoining university
        There was a Missa brevis, performed at Salzburg’s Kollegienkirche, 
        and a mass for Leopold’s landlord, Hagenauer, although dedicated to 
        him in his role as 'Father Domenicus' Hagenauer. Hence, the Domenicus
        Mass was performed at the abbey church of St Peter, Salzburg, on 15 October.
        
        It was in the autumn, on 27 November to be exact, that Mozart’s
        world changed, quite considerably. He was given the post of Konzertmeister
        to the Salzburg court. Although the role came without pay, the 
        significance of this opportunity is hard to overestimate. This was a
        13-year-old boy being given the job as a composer and conductor to the prince
        archbishop of one of the major principalities of the Holy Roman Empire
