        <b>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b> was born on 27 
        January 1756 to Leopold Mozart <i>(1719–1787)</i>
        and Anna Maria, née Pertl <i>(1720–1778)</i>, at
        Getreidegasse 9 in Salzburg. <b>Salzburg</b> was the 
        capital of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, an
        ecclesiastic principality in the Holy Roman Empire. 

        He was the youngest of seven children, five
        of whom died in infancy. His elder sister was
        Maria Anna Mozart <i>(1751–1829)</i>, nicknamed "Nannerl". 
        Mozart was baptised the day after his birth, 
        at St. Rupert's Cathedral in Salzburg. The baptismal
        record gives his name in Latinized form, 
        as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus
        Mozart. He generally called himself "Wolfgang Amadè
        Mozart"as an adult, but his name had many variants.
