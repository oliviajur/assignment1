        No longer newlyweds, and now living in a new
        flat, Mozart continued to devote himself to his
        new life as, more or less, one of the worldâ€™s 
        first freelance composers.

        Mozart was beginning to be talked about in 
        Vienna. All he had to do now was sustain this
        level of interest. This would not have been
        easy for Mozart, as he was effectively his own
        concert promoter as well as the star of the 
        show. As such, he had a choice to make. He could
        sit and wait for commissions to come his way or, 
        alternatively, he could push himself forward 
        into the limelight and force the issue. His choice
        of the latter pathway appeared to be paying 
        early dividends.

        At home, at the time of his concert in front
        of the emperor, Constanze would have been 6 months
        pregnant, and, on 17 June 1783, she gave birth 
        to a baby boy, whom they named Raimund Leopold

        It seems odd to us now, but the Mozarts took a
        trip to Salzburg to see Leopold, leaving Raimund
        Leopold behind in Vienna while he was still a young
        baby. While they were away, their son died and 
        the Mozarts headed back to Vienna. On the way, their
        coach called in at Linz, where Mozart quickly realised
        that if he could write a symphony there and then, 
        there would be an opportunity to have it performed in
        a concert in the Linz theatre. And so that is exactly 
        what he did. Within days, it was completed and 
        was then played at a concert on 4 November.

        Eventually, the couple returned to Vienna, sad and
        exhausted. In fact, Mozart himself was quite ill, 
        possibly with a viral infection. The year that had 
        begun so well with carnivals and balls ended with 
        bereavement and illness.
