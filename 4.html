        Mozart’s time in Italy continued with sightseeing
        in Naples, before he headed back to Rome to 
        receive an honour from the Pope. He was awarded
        the Order of the Golden Spur in a ceremony which
        saw him dressed in full honours regalia. In 
        late July, the father and son team arrived in 
        Bologna. Leopold had a bit of an accident and they
        were forced to rest up at the estate of Count 
        Pallavicini, just outside the city Despite the 
        temporary hold up, Mozart’s reputation was moving
        on in leaps and bounds. The accolades continued in
        Bologna: he was admitted to the prestigious Accademia
        Filarmonica and given a diploma. No doubt the 
        ailing Leopold would rather have had money and 
        commissions than honours and diplomas. As he would
        later say: “Nice words, tributes and cries of 
        bravo will pay neither the postman nor the landlord!”

        The taste of success continued into the new year
        of 1771. Just days before his 15th birthday, Mozart
        received yet more honours, this time a diploma from 
        the Accademia Filarmonica of Verona. Italy, it seemed,
        was taken with Mozart.

        New Year 1773 saw Mozart focused very much on 
        Salzburg. A new prince archbishop meant a completely
        new start for the Mozarts. Nothing could be taken for 
        granted — relationships needed to be forged, positions
        needed to be maintained. For the enthronement 
        ceremony, Mozart set to music words by the grand old
        man of the libretto world, the 74-year-old poet, Metastasio.
        It wasn’t an opera, it wasn’t an oratorio, it was a
        'dramatic serenade', was successfully performed at the
        enthronement on 1 May that year. Again, although it was 
        undoubtedly of good quality and certainly important 
        at that moment, it has not survived the test of time
        to claim a place in the general repertoire.
