        Mozart’s mind continued to be occupied 
        with two things: composing his new opera
        and romancing Miss Constanze Weber. He also
        found himself having to fend off his 
        increasingly curmudgeonly dad in his letters.
        It would be easy to read Leopold’s letters 
        and gain the impression that his son was a 
        disappointing dropout rather than an increasingly
        famous composer. Leopold didn’t let up 
        the pressure on Mozart in these years and it
        was to Mozart’s credit that he never completely
        lost his temper with his father.

        Mozart’s wedding day was on 4 August 1782. He
        and Constanze were married at the impressive 
        St Stephen’s Cathedral, a very grand building, 
        which was effectively their local church. Just
        a few weeks into his marriage, although blissfully
        happy with Constanze, he was already having 
        trouble with the mother-in-law.
